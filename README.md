# Fuzzy-Logic-for-E-commerce-Product-Recommendations
This project implements a Fuzzy Logic-based recommendation system tailored for E-commerce platforms. Instead of using rigid rules, fuzzy logic enables the system to handle uncertainty and imprecise preferences for product suggestions.

###
Recommend products based on price, popularity, and ratings.

Fuzzy sets to handle subjective preferences (e.g., cheap, moderate, expensive).

Fuzzy inference system to combine multiple user preferences.

Scalable and extendable to other product attributes.

### Technologies Used
Python — Core programming language

scikit-fuzzy — Fuzzy logic modeling

Matplotlib — Visualization of fuzzy sets

Tkinter - For GUI
